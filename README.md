# DLA_with_instability
DLA with instability effects is a code I made personally, and mostly for my own use that can generate DLA clusters
These clusters have instability built into them if you want using a neighbor-based probability.

# IT IS NOT YET OPTIMIZED AND SO ANY ADDITIONS ARE QUITE WELCOME

# Packages needed:
[1] Armadillo 9.x
[2] Eigen(You can download and unzip it in the main folder and that should be enough)
